# Open Data API Specification

Open Banking is creating standards which enable data providers to supply information in a uniform format via APIs.
These API specifications can be used by anyone to build APIs providing up-to-date location information about branches
and ATMs, and detailed product information for personal and business current accounts, unsecured loans for lending
to small to medium enterprises and commercial credit cards. As a developer, you can use these specifications to build applications
that make it easier for personal and business customers to compare whatâ€™s offered by different banks.

These API specifications are currently a pre-release beta and thus not yet supported.
Please register at https://www.openbanking.org.uk/contact/register/
to get access to updates and support from March 2017, when these specifications are scheduled for public release.
Please note, use of these specifications is subject to our Open Licence terms, which are available at https://www.openbanking.org.uk/open-licence/ .
 
This repository is used as a publishing endpoint for our deliverables:

* `opendata.raml` - RAML specification
* `opendata-swagger.json` - Swagger specification

Additionally, it contains JSON schemas for the following resources, as separate files:

* ATM
* Branch
* Personal Current Account
* Business Current Account
* Unsecured SME Loan
* Commercial Credit Card

Publishing occurs automatically, based on stable commits from the `opendata-api-spec` repository.
